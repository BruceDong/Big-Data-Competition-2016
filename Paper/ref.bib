  Abstract                 = { This study investigated the effects on bikesharing ridership levels of demographic and built environment characteristics near bikesharing stations in three operational U.S. systems. Although earlier studies focused on the analysis of a single system, the increasing availability of station-level ridership data has created the opportunity to compare experiences across systems. In this study, particular attention was paid to data quality and consistency issues raised by a multicity analysis. This project also expanded on earlier studies with the inclusion of the network effects of the size and spatial distribution of the bikesharing station network, which contributed to a more robust regression model for the prediction of station ridership. The regression analysis identified a number of variables that had statistically significant correlations with station-level bikesharing ridership: population density; retail job density; bike, walk, and transit commuters; median income; education; presence of bikeways; nonwhite population (negative association); days of precipitation (negative association); and proximity to a network of other bikesharing stations. Proximity to a greater number of other bikesharing stations exhibited a strong positive correlation with ridership in a variety of model specifications. This finding suggested that, with the other demographic and built environment variables controlled for, access to a comprehensive network of stations was a critical factor to support ridership. Compared with earlier models, this model is more widely applicable to a diverse range of communities and can help those interested in the adoption of bikesharing systems to predict potential levels of ridership and to identify station locations that serve the greatest number of riders. },

  Year                     = {2015},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates the effects of demographic and built environment characteristics near bike sharing stations on bike sharing ridership levels in four U.S. bike share systems: California Bay Area, Chicago, New York, and Minneapolis/St. Paul Bike Share. While previous studies have focused on the analysis of origin stations in isolation, this project considers both origin and destination station characteristics as well as the tripmaking patterns between station pairs. We developed BikeSEM, A Structural Equation Model (SEM) to forecast the ridership between every pair of stations in the bike share system. Using SEM methodology instead of conventional linear regressions we were able to make best use of available ridership data from three demotions: total rentals from each stations, total returns to each stations and ridership between each pair of stations. Forecasting bike share ridership at Origin-Destination level can help to improve future active transportation planning. For example we can prioritize bike path projects knowing popular origin and destination bike station pairs. This project also expands on previous studies by including the network effects of the size and spatial distribution of the bike sharing station network and by comparing experiences across systems; particular attention is paid to data quality and consistency issues raised by a multi-city analysis. Relative to previous models, this model will be more widely applicable to a diverse range of communities and help those interested in adopting bike sharing systems to predict potential levels of ridership and identify station locations that will serve the greatest number of riders.},
